Here are some projects that I'm at least somewhat proud of. For now, I'm just adding projects that were part of my Master's degree at McMaster University. 

## Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes

[Presentation on Martingales and related processes](files/Probability_and_Stochastics/martingales_intro_notes.pdf)

## Bayesian Nonparametrics

[Detailed proof of showing that the proportions from the CRP converge in distribution to the GEM distribution](files/NPBayes/NPBayes_hmwk3.pdf)

[Provided a detailed proof showing that the size-biased permutations of the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution is given by the 2 parameter GEM distributions](files/NPBayes/NPBayes_hmwk4.pdf)
