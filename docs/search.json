    "text": "About Me\nI’m currently in my final few months of my Master’s in Statistics at McMaster. This has been a rather good program. I (and hopefully my cohort) have acquired a lot of good practical skills in our modelling courses, both in coding as well as model fitting. I’ve also been given great introduction’s to probability theory, stochastic processes, and Bayesian nonparametrics from non other than Dr. Foreman and Dr. Feng. I really have learned a lot taking this track, and perhaps I’ve learned an equal amount about myself. I began to realize why exactly I’m drawn to doing all this hard stuff; it’s because I love learning with a reckless abandon. I love breaking complex concepts down, and understanding things right from the ground up. Abusing this analogy, I would describe my learning process as follows: \\\nSuppose I was given the process of building a house by myself. Of course, since I don’t have the current knowledge on how to build one, my task would be first would be to find a house (preferably abandoned), and start taking it apart. \\\nPerhaps being a subject of my own confirmation bias, I hold the opinion that my passion for learning the inner workings of things have a good edge when it comes to this era of generative AI since I seldom will allow myself to use something that I don’t know how works."
